## Whisper - Decentralized and Private Microblogging Platform

This project is a porting of the [EtherTweet](https://github.com/yep/eth-tweet) application as a private contract on [Secret Network](https://github.com/enigmampc/SecretNetwork). There are several advantages of using Secret Network over Ethereum for such an application:

1. Following can be implemented because your follower list is private.
2. Posts can be shared only with specified people, and followers can be blocked.
3. Posts can be deleted.
