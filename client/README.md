# Fardels UI

To run the Fardels UI on your local machine run `yarn start` and open `localhost:3000` in your browser. You must have Keplr wallet app installed in your browser with the `holodeck-2` testnet added. 

The current version of the app does not prompt you to add `holodeck-2` as an experimental chain in your wallet. The easiest way to add it is to visit the [AMM Testnet page](https://amm.testnet.enigma.co/swap#Swap) and follow the instructions. You will also need to fill your testnet account with some SCRT from the testnet [faucet](https://faucet.secrettestnet.io).

Built with React, Redux, SecretJS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`
